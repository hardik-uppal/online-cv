    title: Summary
    summary: |
      Machine learning engineer with 2 years of research experience and skills for developing complex algorithms for computer vision and natural language processing.
      Business intelligence developer with 3-year experience managing data warehouses and reporting application for retail clients.
education:
    - degree: MASTER’S OF APPLIED SCIENCE
      university: QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY, KINGSTON, CANADA
      time: 2018 - 2021
      details: |
        Specializing in deep learning and computer vision (CV), my research interests focused on facial analysis using RGB and Depth images. 
        I specifically worked on improving recognitions accuracy of facial recognitions (FR) systems by using novel techniques like multi-modal attention 
        in deep neural network and techniques inspired from transformers. I also focused on distilling RGB and depth relationship information into a network,
        so as to hallucinate depth information inherently, to reduce the dependency of depth sensors in runtime conditions. My coursework included Computational data analysis, wearables and IoT, cluster computing, 
        natural language processing (NLP) using deep learning, analytics & AI for business.
          - GPA: 4.0
          - Thesis: Attention and Depth Hallucination for RGB-D Face Recognition with Deep Learning
    - degree: BACHECLOR OF TECHNOLOGY
      university: GURU NANAK DEV UNIVERSITY, AMRITSAR, INDIA
      time: 2007 - 2011
      details: |
        • Specializing in Electronics and Communication technologies, my studies focused on embedded systems design, digital signal processing, 
        microcontrollers and microprocessors. Along with core eletronics technologies, it also focused on fundamentals of programming, data structures, computer architecture, neural network and fuzzy logic
          - GPA 8.28
experiences:
    - role: RESEARCH ASSISTANT 
      time: 2018 - Present
      company: AIIM-LAB, QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY
      details: |
        • Worked as a research assistant at Ambient Intelligence & Interactive Machines Laboratory (AIIM) for various projects 
        in facial analysis domain. The work entailed reading and analyzing recently published research and staying updated with state-of-the-art on 
        benchmarks in face recognition and detection, emotion recognition and further derivatives. I also implemented current state-of-the-art method 
        and analyzed the failings and advantages of those methods. I authored two publications in ICPR 2020 and IEEE TIFS 2021, and one publication 
        is under review. While working as researcher I was required to be adept in following languages and libraries:
          - Python (with); Tensorflow; Keras; SKLearn; numpy; pandas; matplotlib; seaborn
          - R; Matlab; Octave
          - Latex; Overleaf
          - Python (with); Flask; HTML; CSS
    - role: BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE DEVELOPER
      time: 2015 - 2018
      company: TATA CONSULTANCY SERVICES, INDIA
      details: |
        Worked as a business intelligence (BI) developer for 3 year for biggest I.T. service provider in India. My work majorly included 
        managing and enhancing data warehouses and providing support from extract, transform load (ETL) operations to front-end reporting.
        I also helped created data schemas and frameworks for tools for efficient querying from data sources.
        During this time I have worked across various BI tools and services as listed below
          - SQL; IBM DB2; MySQL; SQL server
          - COGNOS; Tableau; SAP Business Objects
          - IBM Datastage; Composite; Informatica
